# CAT_DOG_CLASSIFICATION
🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Image Classification
This project uses deep learning to classify images of cats and dogs. It is built using TensorFlow/Keras and applies Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with optional transfer learning.

📌 Project Objectives
Build a model to classify whether an image is of a cat or a dog

Apply image preprocessing and data augmentation

Use CNN or pre-trained models like VGG16, MobileNet, or ResNet

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and loss curves

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras

Jupyter Notebook

NumPy, Matplotlib

Google Colab / Jupyter Lab
